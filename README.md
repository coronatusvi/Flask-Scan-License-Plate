# flask-scan-license-plate
 Flask-Scan-License-Plate Flask-Scan-License-Plate is a web application built with the Flask framework in Python. It provides a simple and efficient way to recognize and extract license plate numbers from vehicle images. The application leverages computer vision and deep learning techniques to accurately detect and read license plates, making it a valuable tool for various applications such as parking management, toll systems, and law enforcement. Key Features  License Plate Detection: The application utilizes advanced object detection algorithms to locate and extract license plate regions from uploaded images or video frames. Optical Character Recognition (OCR): Once the license plate region is identified, the application employs state-of-the-art OCR techniques to accurately recognize and extract the license plate number. RESTful API: Flask-Scan-License-Plate exposes a RESTful API endpoint that allows users to submit images or video frames for license plate recognition. The API returns the detected license plate number or an appropriate error message. User-Friendly Interface: In addition to the API, the application provides a user-friendly web interface where users can upload images or video files for license plate recognition. The recognized license plate numbers are displayed on the interface for easy viewing. Customizable and Extensible: The application is designed to be customizable and extensible, allowing developers to integrate their own object detection and OCR models or leverage pre-trained models for improved performance.
